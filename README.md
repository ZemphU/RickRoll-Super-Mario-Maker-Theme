Installation instructions and whatnot-

  What you most definitely need:
    Homebrew for your Wii U
    a redNAND or sysNAND cfw fw.img on the root of your SD/USB
    cfwbooter
    SDCaffine
   
  Assuming you have all of these things on your SD Card, you'll have to add the files first.
    1. On the root of your SD card or USB drive, create a folder called "00050000-1018DC00" if you live in the USA or "00050000-1018DD00" if you live in Europe. (THE NAME IS VERY IMPORTANT. I SUGGEST TO USE COPY-PASTE)
